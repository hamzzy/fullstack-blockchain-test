Blockchain in the car industry

Introduction:

Nowadays every household owns a car. More than 69% of cars in Croatia are more than 10 years old.

When you want to buy a preowned vehicle, it is almost impossible to retrieve all details and historical data about services, inspections, etc.

Project description:

The goal of this task is to make customer's lives easier - create a transparent system that will store information about vehicles and scheduled service appointments.

Along with it, it is required to create a simple GUI for official service workers where they will be able to enter service data and for the general audience where they can look up the data per VIN.

Minimal set of components to implement:

    smart-contract

    web GUI

    subgraph

Main features:

    Platform owner should be able to add a new official service worker

    Service worker should be able to add a new car by its VIN

    The service worker should be able to add data for that car for each technical inspection

    Retrieval of vehicle details and all it's data by providing VIN (accessible by anonymous users)

    Subgraph for extracting the data from blockchain and allow fetching the whole registry

**VIN: Vehicle identity number.


Stack:
Smart contracts: NEAR rust or Solidity
Frontend: React or Vuejs

Note:

All projects have to be developed from scratch using git for VC and pushed to one of the popular remote repositories, preferably GitHub. The developer is responsible for repository creation.

Project needs to be tested & demonstrated in the test environment (testnet or local devnet).
